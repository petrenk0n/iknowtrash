DragonHacks 2019 project

I Know Trash introduces the first Cloud-enabled trash bin at DragonHacks 2019 to reinvent how we think about recycling and trash. Our state-of-the-art bin uses Google Cloud Vision API to determine whether something is trash or recycling and allocate it into an appropriate trash bag.

Our project uses a webcam that is connected to the raspberry pi which is running Google's Vision API to determine what item was placed on the top of the trash can. Then, based on what the user has placed in the trash can, drop the item using an automated lid into an appropriate area.
